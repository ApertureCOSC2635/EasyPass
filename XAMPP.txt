Import note these instructions are for Windows systems only!

Step 1 - download XAMPP and install
Step 2 - download Easypass from GIT or otherwise from the *.zip
Step 3 - Copy contents of easypass into C:/XAMPP/htdocs
Step 4A - If you cloned it from GIT duplicate db.config.example as db.config
Step 4B - update db.config with the following details:
	    - name = "easypass"
	    - host = "localhost"
	    - username = "root"  
	    - password = "" # (XAMPP configured no password by default!)
step 4C - if you are using the zip file it has a preconfigured db.config file for XAMPP

step 5 - go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
Step 6 - create easypass database
Step 7 - select easypass DB and select the import tab 
Step 8 - import "easypass.sql" from C:/xampp/htdocs/

step 9 - go to http://localhost/
step 10 - you now have a local instance of easypass running on your machine!

If you are using Linux or MacOS you are on your own but you will need:
1. Apache
2. MySQL
3. PHP 5.6
4. php5-curl
So, build your LAMP stack, copy or clone Easypass, import the db, update DB config and away you go.
