Important note these instructions are for Windows systems only!
Tested with XAMPP 5.6.30 and Windows 10 Creators update

Step 1 - Download XAMPP and install (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) (Tested with )
Step 2 - Download Easypass from GIT (https://github.com/ApertureCOSC2635/EasyPass)
or otherwise copy from the *.zip included in the assignment submission
Step 3 - Copy contents of EasyPass into C:/XAMPP/htdocs (do not purge directory beforehand!)
Step 4A - If you cloned it from GIT duplicate C:/XAMPP/htdocs/db.config.example as db.config
Step 4B - update db.config with the following details:
      - delete the comments!
	    - name = "easypass"
	    - host = "localhost"
	    - username = "root"
	    - password = "" # (XAMPP is configured no password by default!)
step 4C - if you are using the zip file it has a preconfigured db.config file for XAMPP

step 5 - Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
Step 6 - Create easypass database
Step 7 - Select easypass DB and select the import tab
Step 8 - Import "easypass.sql" from C:/xampp/htdocs/

step 9 - Go to http://localhost/
step 10 - You now have a local instance of EasyPass running on your machine!

If you are using Linux or MacOS you are on your own but you will need:
1. Apache
2. MySQL
3. PHP 5.6
4. php5-curl
Also, XAMPP is available for Linux and MacOS. Go nuts!

See README.md for Ubuntu instructions!
So, build your LAMP stack, copy or clone Easypass, import the db,
update DB config and away you go.
